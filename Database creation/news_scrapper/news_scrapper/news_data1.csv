https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/india-a-hub-for-innovation-manufacturing-philips-ceo/articleshow/105108813.cms," India a hub for innovation, manufacturing: Philips CEO ",TNN ," Nov 10, 2023, 08:15 (IST)"," , ,Bengaluru: Roy Jakobs, CEO of Royal ,Philips,, said on Thursday that India is becoming increasingly important for the $19-billion health technology company as an innovation and manufacturing hub, and as a market.,Jakobs was in Bengaluru for the opening of a new 650,000 sqft campus in Yelahanka that will accommodate its nearly 5,000 professionals in the city. ,“This is one of our biggest innovation campuses, that we are also disproportionately investing in, because this is where we have our software capabilities, and also our AI capabilities. More and more significant value is provided through software,” he said. ,The company, he said, spends $1.7 billion annually in innovation and more than half of that is now in software development, of which the biggest part is coming from this campus. ,Philips, a 132-year-old company, has been in India since the 1930s. The innovation campus in Bengaluru was established 27 years ago. Initially it was in the middle of the city in Ulsoor, and then, as it expanded, it moved to Manyata Tech Park in the north. The latest move consolidates all teams in a single building. Jakobs said it will help teams to learn from each other and cross-pollinate ideas.,Philips' revenues come from imaging products like MRI systems, CT scanners and diagnostic x-rays, from ultrasound products, minimally invasive therapy solutions, and patient monitoring solutions. It also has male grooming and beauty products. Software and AI, Jakobs said, are playing an increasingly big role in all of the health tech products. He said they are helping to optimise workflows so that hospitals can serve more patients. This includes scheduling a patient and planning them into the workflow. ,They are helping optimise the use of scanners. They are reducing scan times. They are helping read images from MRIs, CT scanners and x-rays. “Where there are a lot of scans to be looked at, our software can do a pre-selection of the scans, on the basis of urgency and criticality of patients. It also enables a dual watch – get the AI to look at a scan first, and then the radiologist looks at it,” Jakobs said. The company, he said, is now looking at using generative AI to do tasks like pre-populating ICU patient reports with data collected from the systems so that nurses can avoid spending the 15-20 minutes that they do in writing down patient details. ,The technologists in the Bengaluru campus have been at the centre of developing many such solutions. ,In manufacturing, Jakobs said, Philips is bringing more product lines to India. Already, the company’s Pune plant makes coils for MRI systems, it makes ultrasound products, and mobile surgery products. He said the supplier ecosystem in India needs to be strengthened for Philips to substantially expand manufacturing, and the company is working towards that. India as a market, he said, is growing for Philips, but remains relatively small, because the country spends only 2% of its GDP on healthcare, “one of the lower percentages in the world.” ,FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ,Visual Stories, , , ,Previous,Top 8 vegetarian alternatives to chicken for protein intake,Food,Signs you have excellent parenting skills,india,Ritika Singh: A kaleidoscope of radiance in captivating frames,india,From Air India to Kingfisher Airlines: 10 most iconic cabin crew uniforms from India,india,10 biggest K-Beauty trends of 2023,india,8 healthy habits to stay fit and young after 40,india,Most expensive things owned by Virat Kohli,india,12 lesser-known South Indian snacks every foodie should try,Food,​Memorable performances of Nayanthara​,india,Rarest trees and flowers in the world,india, ,Next,1,2,3,Elections,Assembly Elections 2023,Chhattisgarh Elections Phase 1,Telangana Election 2023 Date,Mizoram Election Dates,Madhya Pradesh Elections,Rajasthan Election Date 2023,TOP TRENDS,World Cup 2023 Final,India GDP,India vs Australia highlights,KL Rahul,Israel Hamas War News,Uttarakhand Tunnel Collapse"

The technology has been taken to 85 countries and has been published in over 50 peer-reviewed papers. Another Indian deep tech venture, Agnext, has developed hardware and software that can determine the quality of food items at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional methods. , , ,Mumbai based Qure.ai uses AI to scan xrays and CT scans. In less than a minute, their product can tell the doctor or radiologist if there’s a problem – be it a stroke or lung cancer or tuber culosis. It can even identify prob lems that a busy radiologist might miss. For stroke patients in remote locations, the solution pro vides a level of care that has been unimaginable.,The AI solutions save time, costs, and improve clinical outcomes.,Anumeha Srivastava, chief customer officer at Qure.ai, said on our webinar last week that this technology built in India has been taken to 85 countries. The solutions have been the result of deep research work involving multiple disciplines. “One of our first papers was published in Lancet (the renowned peer reviewed general medical journal). Since then, we have published more than 50 peer reviewed papers,” she said.,India is starting to see really exciting ,deep tech, ventures like Qure.AI, and that was the focus of our discussion on the webinar, which we held in association with Nasscom on the occasion of its Future Forge event (previously called Product Conclave). Deep tech ventures build researchdriven products that solve deep problems, they make fundamental breakthroughs in emerging technology areas. Such ventures are critical for India to emerge as a global innovation hub.,Agnext has built hardware and software, including sensors and AI, that can determine the quality of a food item at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional methods. Subrat Kumar Panda, chief technology & product officer at the Chandigarhbased company, said traditional processes involve specialised chemists and lab instruments to determine, for instance, the physical characteristics and the pungency of chilli in order to fix its price. “This test, traditionally, would take 24 hours, and cost over Rs 1,500. Our technology can test this out in two minutes, at a fraction of the cost,” he said. Agnext has begun to take the product to global markets, and is working on filing patents.,Till quite recently, ecommerce companies weren’t seen as deep tech ventures; they were just platforms enabling buyers and sellers to come together. Today, Flipkart has gone way beyond that. Jeyandran Venugopal, chief product & technology officer at the pioneering venture, said they have a data science team of several 100 people that regularly publishes research papers in top global journals. The company has built IPs (intellectual property) in a number of areas – algorithmic pricing, advertising technology, trust & safety in ecommerce – and which it has converted into SaaS products that are being sold to e retailers in South Africa, West Asia, and North and South America.,This business, Venugopal said, has been growing almost 100% yearonyear since incubation twothree years ago. Ramkumar Narayanan, chairperson of Nasscom DeepTech Council, and VP of Technology & MD at VMware, said India has about 3,400 deep tech startups. The next wave of companies that will get created, he said, will be around deep tech. “Our projection is that by 2030, there will be a 30x growth, with many Indian companies stepping into the global market,” he said.,Four challenges However, he noted that there are four big challenges that India must overcome. One is funding Institutional investors are not often ready to fund basic research.,The government needs to step in. Narayanan said the National Research Foundation established earlier this year, with a Rs 50,000 crore corpus, is a good beginning. The second challenge is talent. While India has a broad talent base, deep tech, Narayanan noted, involves an extra layer of complexity in the talent base required, one where “hardware, software, physics, chemistry, biology, all,come together.” Venugopal said that while the Flipkart brand attracts talent from the best universities in the world and the company has established R&D centres in Seattle and Israel, the talent pool available in emerging deep tech areas is very small, and the only way to build such talent is to upskill existing talent. Panda said it’s very important for the govern ment to find ways to create skilled talent in tier2 and 3 loca tions, talent that can be used to develop products at scale. Narayanan noted that educational in stitutions are starting to create crossdomain disciplines in their degree programmes.,The third challenge, Narayanan said, is market access. He said Nasscom is talking to regulators in different parts of the world to persuade them to accelerate regulatory recognition for Indian startups certified by Nasscom. ,Anumeha said Qure.ai focused a lot on building a brilliant regulatory function. Today, most of its products are US FDA approved. The final challenge, Narayanan said, is around policy advocacy with the government. Here, he said, there’s been significant progress, with a deep tech policy in the works. The policy is expected to address all of the big issues deep tech ventures face.,FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ,Visual Stories, , , ,Previous,10 Most Affordable Cities in India to Buy a House,india,Most Visited Monuments in India,india,The Pros and Cons of Investing in Value Stocks,india,Investing in Small-Cap Stocks: Top 10 Tips for Absolute Beginners,india,10 Ways to Earn Money Online by Selling Physical Products,india,Richest Cricket Players Across the World,india,10 Things You Didn’t Know About Warren Buffett’s Investment Process,india,Priyanka Chopra Net Worth: Know How Rich is Global Actress,india,Top 10 Benefits of Investing in Small-Cap Stocks,india,15 Best Tax Saving Schemes in India,india, ,Next,1,2,3,Elections,Assembly Elections 2023,Chhattisgarh Elections Phase 1,Telangana Election 2023 Date,Mizoram Election Dates,Madhya Pradesh Elections,Rajasthan Election Date 2023,TOP TRENDS,Israel Hamas War News,South Africa vs Afghanistan,Delhi Pollution News,Mahua Moitra,Delhi Rain,Air India Canada"

Take the case of Apple. The Tim Cook-led company is one of the few companies that has a solid equation with China. The likes of Meta and ,Microsoft, don’t operate in the company due to a variety of reasons. Microsoft CEO ,Satya Nadella,has come out and said that he is fine with how things are with China.,In an interview with CNBC, Nadella spoke about how,national security, is one of the reasons, Microsoft is happy with the status quo. “It’s clear that the United States has a particular set of policy decisions that they’re making on what it means to both have trade and competition and national security,” Nadella said. “Obviously, we are subject to what the USG decides” and will be compliant, he added.,The Microsoft CEO’s comments come after the US and China have had tense relations. The US has restrictions that deter US companies from trading with their Chinese counterparts. National security — something which Nadella pointed out — has often been cited as the key reason behind these restrictions. ,Microsoft’s manufacturing reliance on China,Microsoft does operate some of its services and apps in the country. For example, ,Bing Search, is operational in China. But Microsoft did shutter down LinkedIn in China two years ago. The company is still dependent on China for manufacturing its hardware devices. Nadella said that it’s not an issue that Microsoft doesn’t make money from China. “At least for us, today, the majority of our business is in the United States and in Europe and in the rest of Asia, and so we don’t see this as a major, major issue for us, quite frankly, other than any disruption to supply chain,” Nadella said.,Microsoft does business with Chinese companies, Nadella said. “A lot of the Chinese multinationals operating outside of China are our bigger AI customers, perhaps,” he revealed in the interview.,FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ,Visual Stories, , , ,Previous,10 ‘best’ camera 5G phones under Rs 30,000,Gadgets,5G smartphones with a headphone jack under Rs 20,000,Gadgets,5G smartphones with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage under Rs 25,000,Gadgets,5G smartphones with 50MP camera or more under Rs 20,000,Gadgets,5G smartphones with 512GB or more storage under Rs 45,000,Gadgets,5G smartphones under Rs 15,000 with 5000mAh battery or more,Gadgets,5G smartphones under Rs 16,000 with AMOLED display,Gadgets,10 5G smartphones under Rs 30,000 to gift this Diwali,Gadgets,5G smartphones with 13MP or more selfie camera under Rs 20,000,Gadgets,10 5G smartphones under Rs 15,000 to gift this Karwa Chauth,Gadgets, ,Next,1,2,3,Elections,Assembly Elections 2023,Chhattisgarh Elections Phase 1,Telangana Election 2023 Date,Mizoram Election Dates,Madhya Pradesh Elections,Rajasthan Election Date 2023,TOP TRENDS,World Cup Final,SpaceX Starship,Rohit Sharma,Israel Hamas War News,Mitchell Marsh,Uttarakhand Tunnel Collapse"
